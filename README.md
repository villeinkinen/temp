Deforestation and reforestation over 1995-2015. Defined as 5 consequtive years of forest/non-forest in 1990-1994 and 2016-2020

Deforestation and reforestation over 1995-2015. No requirement of stable land cover before and after.

While the patterns are preserved, the differences are not marginal:

Notes:

- Most reforestation came from the category "Other non-forest natural formation" (13).
- Most deforestation came from pasture + agriculture. "Other non-forest" still a significant contributor.

Questions:

- Is other non-forest a residual category?
  - Prediction error high -> "other" vs. separately trained and classified "other"
- Misclassification between other non-forest and grassland, pasture, and agriculture?
